What one do you have and why do you like it?\n","---\n","Bloating + Pain reduction over time on Elemental Diet: Day 1: improved bloating before bed - **down 60%**, no pain aside from cramping Day 2-3: bloating improves - **down 75%**, slight cramping pain Day 4: bloating **down 90-95%**!! No more cramping from smoothies Day 5-20: Abdomen is back to normal, bloating **down 100%** Many people get diarrhea on an ED, but this didn't happen to me to any significant degree (only happened on one day). Although I'm not diabetic, I also tracked blood sugar changes from day 2 to 15 with a continuous glucose monitor (Freestyle Libre 2) as a fun experiment. I wanted to see if taking the smoothies would increase blood sugar--and to my surprise it did more than I expected--although it was still in the healthy range (3.9-10.0 mmol/L or 70.3-180.0 mg/dl). Each spike in the picture below corresponds to 1 smoothie I had (300 kcal/hour).\n","---\n","I am a first time user of the FreeStyle Libre 2 and need some help. I have the sensor in my arm and connected it to the reader so far. I want to connect it to the app on my phone but when I try to connect it I get a message saying “sensor already in use.\n","---\n","I’ve been doing carpentry for over 30 years and I have no idea what I’m supposed to do with my toolbelt at this point and how I’m supposed to wear this pump on a daily basis without completely destroying it or ripping it out. Thinking about trying a tool vest? I’ve ripped out the Dexcom at least three times in the last six months and I figure the pump won’t be far behind. So I’ve been trying to find a type of men’s tank top with a pocket that can go underneath my winter clothing as I work outside. And also I can get double use out of it by wearing in the summer as well.I can’t seem to find a good type of clothing that is a men’s style, lots of women’s styling but nothing for men.\n","---\n","Hey, fellow cyborgs. I’m a criminal defense attorney, and I’m transitioning from district court to superior court, which means jury trials! I am considering approaching the bench before trial to explain that I have diabetes and (1) could have a blood sugar problem mid-trial and need to step away to correct it, and (2) wear a pump and cgm that rarely cause audible alarms but technically could, so the court should be aware. How do other attorneys handle this? Do you say nothing and hope for the best, or do you let the court know?\n","---\n","2 days ago I accidentally forgot I took my long acting insulin.. and took it again. Dexcom said LOW (below 30) for about half an hour. I didn’t pass out but my body was convulsing very hard. Every muscle was shaking so violently it just looked like I was having the world smallest seizure.\n","---\n","Recently I broke my phone and received a new one in the mail. When on the Play Store Dexcom G6 app was not supported on Android 12 only 11 and under. To get the Dexcom G6 app I searched \"Dexcom G6 APK File\" and found a few websites that worked to get the app installed. I changed my sensor and transmitter to this app and sure enough everything is working well and no flaws. Thanks guys and good luck on your Rollercoaster!\n","---\n","So my a1c was 10.9 in January. I got a freestyle Libre 2 February 10 and started low carb the next day. I got my a1c tested yesterday may 3rd and it was 6.6. Since February I went from metformin 1000 x 2, jardiance 25, and glimiperide 4 x2 to not taking glimiperide at all. I do not exercise right now.\n","---\n","type.1loz \"Honest review of the Miao Miao 2 in use with the Freestyle Libre 1 ⚪️... Basically the MM2 turns my Libre1 into a continuous glucose monitor meaning I get updated readings sent to my phone and Apple Watch every 5 minutes without having to scan! ??\n","\n","I honestly LOVE it❗️this device is so good for the price in terms how how it changes my experiences as a diabetic. Being able to view my glucose readings on my watch and my phone screen without even scanning it is such a game changer ! ... ??\n","\n","The MM2 app also displays a graph like the Libre app and places a dot on the graph every 5 minutes representing your blood glucose level (without scanning!). This is a huge help as you can click the dots and it tells you the glucose reading and time the reading was taken which means if I ever go low or high I can click the dot which signifies the change in my levels and it shows me the exact time in which my levels started to change, helping me workout what has caused my fluctuation! ????\n","\n","I 10/10 recommended ????\"#diabetes #freestylelibre #t1dlookslikemet1 #type1diabetic #type1strong #diabeteslife #t2d #miaomiao2 #diabetescommunity #diabeticproblems #fuckdiabetes #beyondtype1 #bloodglucose #diabetestechnology\n","---\n","I (type 1)have been using a Medtronic pump and cgm for many years and it has always been covered by my insurance. Recently my insurance has changed to Medicare and the cgm's are not covered. I am researching options to find what is actually covered and affordable. I was told the new Omnipod will be synced the the Dexcom and both are covered.\n","---\n","I have a tslim pump/dexcom g6 combo right now and I have been using the t:connect app on my phone to easier see some of the info and so my endo can see my numbers when the app syncs up. I updated my phone's (galaxy 21+) OS late last week and since then the app crashes as soon as I open in. I ended up calling their customer service and it turns out they are aware of the problem and are currently trying to fix it. If you are having this problem too, you can call them and get added to their notification list so when they have a fix they will let you know.\n","---\n","Hey fellow type 1's. I want to use a dexcom g6 with a slim and light smartwatch or fitbit, i like understatement. What model do you use? Can you give me some recommendations please.\n","---\n","Hi ok so type 1 diabetic for 12 years, I’ve never paid much attention to my blood sugar highs during my period but just recently got a dexcom so now I’m aware 24/7. I am also on new birth control. Excuse the TMI but I recently got my period since the new pill and because I now see the blood sugar graphs, all I’ve seen these last 3 days is everything high on the yellow area, the pump is always giving me control iq bolus plus I’ve myself too many rage boluses and today it has not come down from 250+.\n","---\n","So, I have no CGM coverage for the next few days minimum, a first since diagnosis. How often do I need to test my sugars with the meter for the next few days\n","---\n","My dexcom has not given me an accurate reading in like 4 days. All it does is say \"wait 3 hours\" then give me 2 absurdly wild readings (stuff that would have severe consequences if I assumed it was right and acted on said numbers), and then it goes back to the 3 hours. It feels like Dexcom is just making up 2 random readings so I can't get a replacement because it hasn't \"failed\". It honestly feels like I'm being scammed. I am supposed to be getting somewhat accurate readings, not 2 hours of nothing and then 2 readings of either 56 or 347, then 2 more hours of nothing. Last time I removed the dexcom and asked for a replacement before it failed, they gave me a really hard time. Can I force it to fail somehow so they'll replace it without the hassle? Or do you think they would replace it for me bc it sucks? Also does anyone else ever have any experiences like that? Dexcom just holding on for dear life and not failing despite not giving you ANY good readings for days? Like I said I feel like this is intentional, it feels like Dexcom is doing this so they can cheap out on replacements. Any way let me know your thoughts and thank you :)\n","---\n","So far I've used different kinds of waterproof tapes but it's always a mess so I wonder what are your successful tactics? :) Currently considering 2 options: * Patches that are easy to put on top (any recommendations?) * [An armband](https://www.amazon.nl/Abbott-Freestyle-Libre-Ondersteunt-Glucosesensor/dp/B07W4LV944). But I've only seen it on Amazon NL for some reasons. Feel free to propose another one! Thanks for the tips :)\n","---\n","I *was* considering buying a miao miao for my freestyle libre sensors (which I am very happy with), so I can have some sort of CGM functionality. However, I see both Libre 1 and 2 generation sensors have alleged communication capabilities with [certain smartphones](https://freestyleserver.com/Payloads/IFU/2022/q1/ART39109-001_rev-T_Web.pdf), via the LibreLink app. I'd have to upgrade though, as my current phone (iphone SE gen1) is not compatible.\n","---\n","My 3 year old T1D will have his own iPhone he will wear when he goes to preschool so he can use it as his Dexcom receiver. I will use the follow app to see his numbers. Can I also see the follow app on my Apple Watch?\n","---\n","Today’s hike was 90 minutes long and, annoyingly, my blood sugars dropped more than I wanted so I had to eat a glucose tablet 10 minutes before the end of the hike. Not the end of the world, and I was proactive and caught it before I really went low, so I never crashed. Being able to proactively prevent lows is probably my favorite part about wearing a CGM. Because low blood sugars suck ??\n"," \n","#diabetes #type1diabetes #type2diabetes #t1d #t2d #insulindependent #bloodsugar #diabasass #diabetesawareness\n","---\n","My a1C has never been in the optimal range, and my blood sugars usually trend high (180-350). I've always been overweight, and I think I have some insulin resistance. I've never tried a CGM or pump because apart from having a phobia of medical devices attached to people, I make no money and am on my state's health insurance. I've always thought that CGMs and pumps were out of my price range, so I just...didn't bother looking into getting one, because what's the point if I can't afford it. I'm starting to get really anxious because in the past few days I've started getting a slightly painful pins and needles feeling in both of my feet.\n","---\n","Sometimes I wonder how sugar + diet impact my moods. I want to experiment with wearing a CGM ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous\\_glucose\\_monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_glucose_monitor)). Has anyone done this and willing to share experience? I can't find any research papers or studies looking at Bipolar and CGMs.\n","---\n","HOW am I witnessing a girl on tik tok saying her blood sugar is all over the place WHEN SHE ISNT DIABETIC AND HER BLOODS ARE LITERALLY FINE??? bitch has even paid for a freestyle libre ??\n","---\n","Hello, Can I use the DexCom G6, an IPhone 6s and a Fossil watch gen. 5E together and see my blood levels on my watch?\n","---\n","I was diagnosed with diabetes almost 20 years ago and have only recently begun to take my diet seriously. My normal A1c readings have been in the 7 to 8 range. Last year I received a Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) and it clearly showed what food is doing to me. 4 months ago I saw an A1c of 6.7 which was my best reading since being diagnosed. I began to get more serious about removing carbs from my diet and being diligent about everything that I ate.\n","---\n","I've been using a Freestyle Libre for almost two weeks now, and I'm wondering what to make of my typical daily glucose pattern. * Overnight: pretty steady, just over 100 mg/dL * Dawn Effect: from 6am to 9am, it rises to my daily peak around 125 mg/dL. I only have a couple of cups of coffee during this period. ... * Evening: from 6-8pm until 12am I'm pretty steady around 100, going into the overnight period. I'm concerned that, at these levels, my insulin is never dropping enough to allow me to burn much body fat. I've been stuck on a plateau for a *long* time now, and I started the CGM to try to figure out why. CGM users who are losing weight: do you have a similar pattern? What's your baseline?\n","---\n","In 2021, I saw a lot of Influencers who were not** diabetic buy continuous glucose monitors to see how they’re sugar levels were responding daily. Weird? Definitely. ... The most popular reason for getting a CGM was for more information on their sugar readings before, after or in between meals and to see how their glucose levels responded during exercise. This is my opinion and I welcome yours in the comments below. If you’re not a diabetic, you do not need a cgm to know what your sugar levels are. To break this down; this means, if you’re not diagnosed with a type of diabetes such as Type 1, Type 2, gestational, MODY, LADA, Type 3C, have a different condition that affects glucose levels, have an HOMA-IR problem (Insulin resistance due to hormonal issues) and so on than your body WILL naturally control your insulin levels for you!!! It displays a very unethical form of compassion to those that need the CGM to live. Although influencers are humans and they do make mistakes, it’s important to remember that it’s not essential on their behalf to know glucose readings with no diabetes symptoms present. If the answer is yes, then the influencer can use a finger poke meter and take notes of their results.\n","---\n","But I do have a history of things lowering my blood sugar that raise most other peoples blood sugar. Lack of sleep, stress, cigarettes (not a regular smoker), all lower my blood sugar significantly. I have a tandem insulin pump and a CGM. I’m also slightly under weight. So these past 2 weeks, I’ve been waking up with blood sugars too low to be calculated.\n","---\n","Hiii all, I mostly use reddit to lurk but I have some questions and was looking for advice. I have never actually counted carbs, I kinda just guesstimate (?) based on the food I'm eating. I have CGM so I guess I just figure I can make adjustments later. For context, I'm a 22M and I have been diagnosed with T1D since I was 11. My homelife growing up was incredibly dysfunctional.\n","---\n"]}],"source":["count = 0\n","for post in jon_samples:\n","    print(post)\n","    count +=1\n","    # only display 5 for cleanliness\n","    #if count == 5:\n","    #    break\n","    print('---')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"GM___2mRYXU-"},"outputs":[],"source":["df_dexcom = df[df[\"Source Name\"]=='r/dexcom']\n","df_dexcom = df_dexcom[df_dexcom['Post Type']=='Original']"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lRuSqiP2YXU_"},"outputs":[],"source":["df_libre = df[df[\"Source Name\"]=='r/Freestylelibre']\n","df_libre = df_libre[df_libre['Post Type']=='Original']"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"A7mejH8BYXU_","outputId":"52fa37e7-d5a2-4689-984d-e8b39f625afd"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Phone suggestions appreciated\n","---\n","New to Dexcom and looking for bandage advice\n","---\n","Will I need the build my own app?\n","---\n","Options for allergic reaction?\n","---\n","Dexcom In Hawaii?\n","---\n","Dexcom G6 IOS 15.4.1\n","---\n","How to know if G6 needle went in?\n","---\n","Question regarding activating Dexcom Sensors With Phone Only\n","---\n","Dexcom G6 vs. BT headphones\n","---\n","Wear OS\n","---\n","Apple Iwatch\n","---\n","Work\n","---\n","Does anyone here know how the Dexcom calibration works?\n","---\n","My phone is no longer compatible with the app\n","---\n","Samsung phone Apple watch Dexcom g6\n","---\n","Anyone else receive expired (but relabeled) sensors?\n","---\n","First impression: not very impressed\n","---\n","Dexcom for people without diabetes\n","---\n","Dexcom G6 - what do you do when it is uncomfortable after applying sensor?\n","---\n","App keeps saying \"transmittor not found\".\n","---\n","Dexcom Follow and Xdrip in EU\n","---\n","Dexcom G6 transmitter failures\n","---\n","I’m starting to get really annoyed with Dexcom G6\n","---\n","392 Days with the Dexcom G6\n","---\n","IOS 15.5 issues?\n","---\n","iOS 15\n","---\n","Best smart watch to pair with Dexcom/phone?\n","---\n","Are my BYOA settings right?\n","---\n","Dexcom g6 and iPhone 13 (IOS 15)?\n","---\n","Can I re-use an old transmitter?\n","---\n","Can I inject it through tegaderm?\n","---\n","Should I get an iOS or Android phone for the G6?\n","---\n","Replacement applicator\n","---\n","Dexcom G6 gives *wild* readings after insertion\n","---\n","Dexcom G6 Samsung VS Apple\n","---\n","Bluetooth issues\n","---\n","New iPhone/iOS\n","---\n","Pixel 5 issues pairing with a transmitter\n","---\n","Dexcom Receiver Question\n","---\n","Free Dexcom G6 Receiver....Unused.
